# SICP
Exercises from [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).

Implemented in [SICP dialect](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html) (`#lang sicp`)  of [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

I watch the [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FE88AA54363BC46) by Abelson and Sussman first, then read the corresponding book chapter and do the exercises.
